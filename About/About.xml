    <description>This mod only contains an electric stonecutter's table. The efficiency of an electric stonecutter's table is 200% that of a stonecutter's table. But like the electric production buildings in RimWorld, construction requires components and can breakdown.

Please feel free to speak up if you have any suggestions or comments.
